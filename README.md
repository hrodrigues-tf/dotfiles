# Hugo does dotfiles

This is a way to personalize your system.


I made this entirely from scratch, any ideas to improve this are welcome but I feel free to not accepted them since this is for my needs.

# Content
I was presented with this amazing idea and wanted to do part of it.

So there it's, my dotfiles with constant updates.

* Updates your system
* Install, updates and configures some packages
* Alias
* Cronjobs
* Notifications

# Install / Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/hugofree17/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
change arguments inside inc folder if needed.
chmod +x bootstrap.sh
./bootstrap.sh for instructions
ex: sudo ./bootstrap.sh -o ubuntu -t all
Wait for the magic to happen.
```
